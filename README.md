# GitHub-GameOff-2022
This code is for the GitHub GameOff 2022! This was a month-long game jam (Nov 1 - Dec 1) that I worked on all by myself (minus the music, I did not make the music). 
The theme for the jam was 'cliches', so I made a zombie shooting game where you play as a priest! So fun!
<br> <br> I will admit, I have never used GitHub before, this is all new to me, hence why the GitHub page is very messy ^^' I am also not a professional coder, 
and most of my knowledge comes from following tutorials and whatnot.
<br><br> I hope you enjoy this project <3 and that my work will continue to improve!
<br><br> Also, major props to Shaun Spalding, who taught me basically everything I know about Game Maker Studio 2!
